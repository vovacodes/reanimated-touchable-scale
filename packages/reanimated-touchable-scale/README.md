## Features

### ðŸš€ Performance First
- Runs animations on the UI thread using Reanimated worklets
- Zero bridge traffic during animations
- Smooth 60+ FPS animations even during heavy bridge load

### ðŸŽ¯ Purposefully Built
- Specifically designed for scale animations on touch
- Optimized spring configurations for natural feeling feedback
- Works great for buttons, cards, and any pressable components really

### ðŸ’ª Production Ready
- Built on stable primitives (Reanimated + Gesture Handler)
- Handles edge cases like rapid taps and interrupted gestures
- TypeScript support
- Supports both Old and New Architecture, iOS and Android

### ðŸŽ¨ Highly Customizable
- Configurable scale values and spring animations
- Supports both JS and UI thread event handlers

### ðŸª¶ Lightweight
- Few dependencies (only Reanimated and Gesture Handler)
- Small implementation (~150 lines of code)
- No external assets or resources
